# Online Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is aimed at detecting online fraud using machine learning techniques. We've developed a model that can classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate, enhancing security for online payments.

## Features

- Fraud detection model
- Dataset analysis
- Model performance evaluation
- Colab notebooks and Python scripts

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (list them here).
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts to understand the model and its implementation.

## Usage
