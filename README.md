Title: Enhancing Online Payment Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

To enhance the detection of online payment fraud through the power of machine learning, we embark on a journey of training a sophisticated model designed to classify payments as either fraudulent or legitimate. Our mission hinges on the availability of a comprehensive dataset that furnishes insights into the intricate realm of online payment fraud. This dataset is the cornerstone upon which our model's success will be built.

In our pursuit of this critical task, we have acquired a meticulously curated dataset from Kaggle. This dataset serves as a treasure trove of historical information related to fraudulent transactions, providing invaluable insights into the patterns and characteristics that typify online payment fraud. Armed with this data, we are poised to develop and implement a robust machine learning model capable of safeguarding online payments from fraudulent activities.
